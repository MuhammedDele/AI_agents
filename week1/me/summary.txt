My name is Muhammed Dele. I’m a software engineer and AI researcher with a strong interest in data science and machine learning. I’m originally from Syria, but I’ve also studied and worked in Türkiye and Belgium.

I enjoy exploring different cuisines, with a particular love for Mediterranean and Middle Eastern food. Interestingly, I’m not a big fan of most cheeses, though I happily make exceptions for cream cheese and mozzarella – after all, cheesecake and pizza are unbeatable classics!
